# Problem 1

Projectile motion involves the motion of an object launched into the air under
the influence of gravity, following a parabolic trajectory. It is analyzed in
two components: horizontal and vertical motion, which are independent of each
other. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown with formulas:

---

### **Key Variables**

-   \( u \): Initial velocity
-   \( \theta \): Angle of projection
-   \( g \): Acceleration due to gravity (\( 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \))
-   \( t \): Time of flight
-   \( R \): Range (horizontal distance covered)
-   \( h\_{\text{max}} \): Maximum height
-   \( x \): Horizontal displacement
-   \( y \): Vertical displacement

---

### **Horizontal Motion**

The horizontal motion is uniform because there is no horizontal acceleration
(ignoring air resistance).

-   **Horizontal velocity:**

    $$
    u_x = u \cos theta
    $$

-   **Horizontal displacement:**
    $$
    x = u_x t = u \cos \theta \cdot
    \
    $$

---

### **Vertical Motion**

The vertical motion is uniformly accelerated due to gravity.

-   **Vertical velocity:**
    $$
    u_y = u \sin \theta
    $$
    At any time \( t \), the vertical velocity is:
    $$
    v_y = u_y - g t = u \sin \theta - g t
    $$
-   **Vertical displacement:**
    $$
    y = u_y t - \frac{1}{2} g t^2 = u \sin \theta \cdot t - \frac{1}{2} g t^2
    $$

---

### **Time of Flight**

The total time the projectile stays in the air:

$$
t_{\text{flight}} = \frac{2 u \sin \theta}{g}
$$

---

### **Range (\( R \))**

The horizontal distance covered during the flight:

$$
R = \frac{u^2 \sin 2\theta}{g}
$$

---

### **Maximum Height (\( h\_{\text{max}} \))**

The highest point reached by the projectile:

$$
h_{\text{max}} = \frac{u^2 \sin^2 \theta}{2g}
$$

---

### **Trajectory Equation**

Combining \( x \) and \( y \):

$$
y = x \tan \theta - \frac{g x^2}{2 u^2 \cos^2 \theta}
$$

This equation represents the parabolic path of the projectile.

---

By applying these formulas, you can analyze and predict various aspects of
projectile motion based on initial conditions like velocity and angle of
projection.
