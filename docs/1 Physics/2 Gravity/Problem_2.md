# Problem 2: Cosmic Velocities and Escape Dynamics

## 1. Theoretical Foundation

### 1.1 Definition and Physical Significance

Cosmic velocities represent fundamental threshold speeds that define different regimes of motion in gravitational fields. These critical velocities govern the transition between bound and unbound motion, making them essential for understanding orbital mechanics and space exploration.

**First Cosmic Velocity (Orbital Velocity)**
The minimum velocity required to achieve a stable circular orbit around a celestial body at its surface.

**Second Cosmic Velocity (Escape Velocity)**
The minimum velocity required to escape a celestial body's gravitational influence completely.

**Third Cosmic Velocity (Heliocentric Escape Velocity)**
The minimum velocity required to escape the Solar System from a planet's orbital position.

### 1.2 Rigorous Mathematical Derivation

#### First Cosmic Velocity (v₁)

For circular orbital motion, the gravitational force provides the centripetal force:

$$F_g = F_c$$

$$\frac{GMm}{r^2} = \frac{mv^2}{r}$$

Solving for velocity:

$$v_1 = \sqrt{\frac{GM}{r}}$$

where:
- G = 6.67430 × 10⁻¹¹ m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻² (gravitational constant)
- M = mass of the central body
- r = orbital radius (surface radius for surface orbit)

#### Second Cosmic Velocity (v₂)

Using conservation of energy for escape conditions:

Initial energy = Final energy (at infinity)

$$E_i = E_f$$

$$\frac{1}{2}mv_2^2 - \frac{GMm}{r} = 0$$

Solving for escape velocity:

$$v_2 = \sqrt{\frac{2GM}{r}}$$

**Key Relationship:**
$$v_2 = \sqrt{2} \cdot v_1 \approx 1.414 \cdot v_1$$

#### Third Cosmic Velocity (v₃)

For escape from the Solar System, we must consider:
1. Escape velocity from the planet (v₂)
2. Orbital velocity around the Sun (v_orbit)

The total energy requirement gives:

$$v_3 = \sqrt{v_2^2 + v_{escape\_sun}^2}$$

where:
$$v_{escape\_sun} = \sqrt{\frac{2GM_{sun}}{r_{orbit}}}$$

### 1.3 Energy Considerations

The total mechanical energy for different motion types:

**Circular Orbit (v = v₁):**
$$E = -\frac{GMm}{2r} < 0$$ (bound orbit)

**Parabolic Escape (v = v₂):**
$$E = 0$$ (critical condition)

**Hyperbolic Escape (v > v₂):**
$$E > 0$$ (unbound trajectory)

## 2. Mathematical Analysis and Applications

### 2.1 Velocity Scaling Laws

From the fundamental equations, we can derive scaling relationships:

**Mass Dependence:**
$$v \propto \sqrt{M}$$

**Radius Dependence:**
$$v \propto \frac{1}{\sqrt{r}}$$

**Surface Gravity Relationship:**
$$v_1 = \sqrt{gr}$$
$$v_2 = \sqrt{2gr}$$

where g = GM/r² is surface gravity.

### 2.2 Practical Calculations

For Earth (M = 5.972 × 10²⁴ kg, R = 6.371 × 10⁶ m):

**First Cosmic Velocity:**
$$v_1 = \sqrt{\frac{(6.674 \times 10^{-11})(5.972 \times 10^{24})}{6.371 \times 10^6}} = 7.91 \text{ km/s}$$

**Second Cosmic Velocity:**
$$v_2 = \sqrt{2} \times 7.91 = 11.19 \text{ km/s}$$

**Third Cosmic Velocity (from Earth's orbit):**
$$v_3 = \sqrt{(11.19)^2 + (29.78)^2} = 31.82 \text{ km/s}$$

## 3. Computational Implementation

Our comprehensive analysis uses advanced numerical methods to calculate and visualize cosmic velocities:

    return np.sqrt(2 * G * mass / radius)

def calculate_third_cosmic_velocity(distance_from_sun, sun_mass=1.989e30):
    """Calculate solar system escape velocity"""
    return np.sqrt(2 * G * sun_mass / distance_from_sun)

## 6. Advanced Concepts

### 6.1 Relativistic Corrections

For very massive objects, relativistic effects become significant:

$$v_{escape} = c\sqrt{1 - \frac{R_s}{r}}$$

where Rs is the Schwarzschild radius. For black holes, the escape velocity approaches the speed of light.

### 6.2 Oberth Effect

The Oberth effect demonstrates that rocket burns are most efficient at periapsis (closest approach), where the spacecraft's velocity is highest. This principle is crucial for efficient interplanetary transfers.

### 6.3 Gravitational Assists

Spacecraft can gain velocity through gravitational assists (slingshot maneuvers), effectively "stealing" orbital energy from planets to achieve higher velocities without additional fuel.
