# Problem 1: Interference Patterns on a Water Surface

## Motivation

Interference occurs when waves from different sources overlap, creating new patterns. On a water surface, this can be easily observed when ripples from different points meet, forming distinctive interference patterns. These patterns can show us how waves combine in different ways, either reinforcing each other or canceling out.

Studying these patterns helps us understand wave behavior in a simple, visual way. It also allows us to explore important concepts, like the relationship between wave phase and the effects of multiple sources. This task offers a hands-on approach to learning about wave interactions and their real-world applications, making it an interesting and engaging way to dive into wave physics.

## 1. Theoretical Foundation

### 1.1 Wave Equation and Cylindrical Wave Solution

A circular wave on the water surface, emanating from a point source located at $(x_0, y_0)$, can be described by the cylindrical wave equation:

$$\eta(x, y, t) = \frac{A}{\sqrt{r}} \cdot \cos(kr - \omega t + \phi)$$

where:
- $\eta(x, y, t)$ is the displacement of the water surface at point $(x, y)$ and time $t$
- $A$ is the amplitude of the wave at unit distance
- $k = \frac{2\pi}{\lambda}$ is the wave number, related to the wavelength $\lambda$
- $\omega = 2\pi f$ is the angular frequency, related to the frequency $f$
- $r = \sqrt{(x - x_0)^2 + (y - y_0)^2}$ is the distance from the source to the point $(x, y)$
- $\phi$ is the initial phase

### 1.2 Physical Basis of the Cylindrical Wave

The $\frac{1}{\sqrt{r}}$ amplitude dependence arises from conservation of energy. For a cylindrical wave spreading in two dimensions, the wave energy is distributed over a circumference proportional to $r$, leading to amplitude decay as $\frac{1}{\sqrt{r}}$.

### 1.3 Dispersion Relation for Water Waves

For deep water waves, the dispersion relation is:
$$\omega^2 = gk$$

where $g$ is the gravitational acceleration. This gives the phase velocity:
$$v_{phase} = \frac{\omega}{k} = \sqrt{\frac{g}{k}} = \sqrt{\frac{g\lambda}{2\pi}}$$

### 1.4 Principle of Linear Superposition

When multiple waves overlap at a point, the resulting displacement is the linear sum of the individual displacements. For $N$ sources, the total displacement is:

$$\eta_{\text{total}}(x, y, t) = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \eta_i(x, y, t) = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \frac{A_i}{\sqrt{r_i}} \cos(kr_i - \omega t + \phi_i)$$

where $r_i = \sqrt{(x - x_{0i})^2 + (y - y_{0i})^2}$ is the distance from the $i$-th source.

### 1.5 Interference Conditions

#### Constructive Interference
Constructive interference occurs when waves arrive in phase. The condition for constructive interference is:
$$\Delta\phi = k(r_i - r_j) + (\phi_i - \phi_j) = 2\pi n$$

where $n$ is an integer and $\Delta\phi$ is the phase difference between waves from sources $i$ and $j$.

#### Destructive Interference
Destructive interference occurs when waves arrive out of phase:
$$\Delta\phi = k(r_i - r_j) + (\phi_i - \phi_j) = (2n + 1)\pi$$

### 1.6 Path Difference and Interference Patterns

For coherent sources with the same phase ($\phi_i = \phi$ for all $i$), the interference condition depends only on the path difference:
$$\Delta r = |r_i - r_j|$$

- **Constructive interference**: $\Delta r = n\lambda$
- **Destructive interference**: $\Delta r = (n + \frac{1}{2})\lambda$

## 2. Mathematical Analysis for Regular Polygons

### 2.1 Geometric Configuration

For a regular $N$-sided polygon with sources at vertices, the source positions are:
$$x_i = R\cos\left(\frac{2\pi i}{N}\right), \quad y_i = R\sin\left(\frac{2\pi i}{N}\right)$$

where $R$ is the circumradius and $i = 0, 1, 2, ..., N-1$.

### 2.2 Symmetry Analysis

The interference pattern exhibits $N$-fold rotational symmetry. At the center of the polygon, all sources are equidistant, leading to constructive interference when:
$$N \cdot \frac{A}{\sqrt{R}} \cos(kR - \omega t + \phi)$$

### 2.3 Far-Field Approximation

For observation points far from the polygon ($r \gg R$), we can use the far-field approximation:
$$r_i \approx r - R\cos(\theta - \frac{2\pi i}{N})$$

where $r$ and $\theta$ are the polar coordinates of the observation point.

### 2.4 Intensity Distribution

The intensity (time-averaged energy flux) is proportional to the square of the amplitude:
$$I(x, y) = \langle|\eta_{\text{total}}(x, y, t)|^2\rangle_t$$

For coherent sources, this includes both the individual intensities and interference terms.
